# Fundamentals-of-Internet-of-Things
Intelligent Mouse Trap prototype developed using a PIR sensor, an LED and dip switches connected to an Arduino UNO. Data collected is sent to Thingspeak and a mobile app was created to notify the user of the presence of a mouse in the trap. The whole system is housed in a shoebox that I modified for this purpose. 

The project demonstrated my ability to ideate and come up with creative solutions to improve an existing device. It also utilized my technical knoweledge on C++ programming and app creation. 

My familiarity with the IOT ecosystem came in handy when choosing the most suitable components for the Intellgent Mouse Trap. 

Attached is documentation which demonstrates how the prototype works from a technical standpoint.
